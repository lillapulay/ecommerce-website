Side project following a [SimpleTut](https://simpletut.com/courses/ecommerce/how-to-build-an-ecommerce-website-using-react-redux-graphql-firebase/) tutorial with some personal tweaks. Through this app I'm practicing React, Redux, Google Firebase, and learning the Stripe Payments API, GraphQL and features like password reset and pagination, amongst others.
